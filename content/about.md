Hi, I'm Mert. I am a computer engineer working as an iOS developer at Wookweb.
I'm developing apps with Swift and SwiftUI.  I've been writing articles about Swift and iOS on Medium recently. 

I'm also interested in music; I'm drummer, producer and DJ's. I really like drinking coffee, watching movies and swimming. You can contact me via my [Twitter](https://twitter.com/mertt_cetinn) account and [e-mail](mailto:mrtctns22@gmail.com).
